# Hazard-detection-in-Amazon-reviews
The ability to purchase products online has provided many advantages for con- sumers in the recent years. With these advantages however, there are also draw- backs. One of these drawbacks, is the fact that ordering online and especially from foreign markets, makes it hard for oversight to properly be carried out by governmental bodies. Products, produced in the EU are subject to safety regu- lations and are often tested before being allowed to be brought onto the market. It is known that, because of the lack of oversight, products are purchased and used that can cause harm to humans. The amount of harm ranges from choking hazard, poisonous materials, burns and even death. Goal of this paper is to give an insight on how to utilize machine learning to tackle this problem and make it easier to detect such hazardous products.
